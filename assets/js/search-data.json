            "content": "Introduction . The Tweedie distribution is a family of probability distributions that include . Normal | Gamma | Inverse Gaussian | Poisson | Compound Poisson-gamma | . The Tweedie distribution is wildly popular in insurance industry as a tool of modelling . claim frequency (count data), | claim severity (non-negative continuous data), and | pure premium (non-negative continous data with a zero mass). | . In this post, we give a brief introduction to the Tweedie distribution and its properties. . Exponential Dispersion Models . Before diving into the Tweedie distribution, we need to understand the exponential dispersion model (EDM) ((Jorgensen, 1986, 1987a; Tweedie, 1947), of which the Tweedie is a special case. . A probability distribution is an EDM if the density/mass function has the following form . $$f(y) = c(y, phi) exp left { frac{y theta- a( theta)}{ phi} right },$$ where $ theta$ is called the canonical parameter and $ phi$ the dispersion parameter. . It can be shown that, $$ mathbb{E}(y):= mu = dot{a}( theta), quad mathrm{Var}(y)= phi ddot{a}( theta)= phi ddot{a}( dot{a}^{-1}( mu))= phi V( mu)$$ . where $ dot{a}$ and $ ddot{a}$ are the first and second derivative of $a$, respectively; $V( mu)$ is called the variance function. . Tweedie Distribution . Now we formally introduce the Tweedie distribution. A Tweedie distribution is an EDM with $$V( mu) = mu^p, $$ where $p in mathrm{R}$. The Tweedie behaves differently when $p$ takes different values. . We consider 5 cases. . Normal ($p=0$) . When $p=0$, the Tweedie distribution becomes a normal distribution with the mean equal to $ mu$ and variance as $ phi$. . Poisson ($p=1$) . When $p=1$, the Tweedie distribution becomes a Poisson distribution if we set $ phi=1$. The resulting Poison mean and variance equal to $ mu$. . Gamma Distribution ($p=2$) . Inverse Gaussian Distribution ($p=3$) . Compound Poisson-Gamma ($1&lt;p&lt;2$) . When $1&lt;p&lt;2$, the Tweedie distribution gives rise to a very interesting class known as the Compound Poisson-Gamma Distribution. . A compound Poisson-Gamma distribution is the distribution of a sum of i.i.d gamma distribution with the number of gamma following a Poisson distribution. . To illusrate the idea, let $N sim mathrm{Poisson}( lambda)$, and $X_i sim Gamma( alpha, beta)$, $i=1,2, dots,N$ be i.i.d gamma distributions. Then $$Y= sum_{i=1}^N X_i$$ is a compound Poisson-Gamma distribution. . Mean and Variance . To calculate the mean of $Y$, . $$ begin{array}{ll} mathbb{E}(Y) &amp;=&amp; mathbb{E}( mathbb{E}(Y|N)) &amp;( text{Law of Total Expectation}) &amp;=&amp; mathbb{E}(N mathbb{E}(X_1))&amp;( text{i.i.d assumption}) &amp;=&amp; mathbb{E}(N alpha/ beta) &amp;( text{Mean of Gamma distribution}) &amp;=&amp; lambda frac{ alpha}{ beta} &amp; ( text{Mean of Poisson distribution}) end{array} $$ To calculate the variance, . $$ begin{array}{ll} mathrm{Var}(Y) &amp;=&amp; mathrm{Var}( mathbb{E}(Y|N)) + mathbb{E}( mathrm{Var}(Y|N))&amp; ( text{Law of Total Variance}) &amp;=&amp; mathrm{Var}(N mathbb{E}(X_1)) + mathbb{E}(N mathrm{Var}(X_1)) &amp;( text{i.i.d assumption}) &amp;=&amp; mathrm{Var}(N alpha/ beta) + mathbb{E}(N alpha/ beta^2) &amp; ( text{Mean and variance of Gamma distribution}) &amp;=&amp; lambda alpha^2/ beta^2 + lambda alpha/ beta^2 &amp;( text{Mean and variance of Poisson distribution}) &amp;=&amp; lambda frac{ alpha(1+ alpha)}{ beta^2} &amp; end{array} $$ Parameter Mapping . $$ lambda = frac{ mu^{2-p}}{(2-p) phi}, quad alpha= frac{2-p}{p-1}, quad beta= frac{ mu^{1-p}}{(p-1) phi} $$ Scale Invariance . Let c be a positive constant, c &gt; 0, and Y a random variable from a certain family of distributions; we say that this family is scale invariant if cY follows a distribution in the same family. This property is desirable if Y is measured in a monetary unit: if we convert the data from one currency to another, we want to stay within the same family of distributions—the result of a tariff analysis should not depend on the currency used. . It can be shown that the only EDMs that are scale invariant are the so called Tweedie models, which are defined as having variance function v(μ) = μp (2.9) for some p. The proof can be found in Jörgensen [Jö97, Chap. 4], upon . Tweedie Deviance . (1992) . The EDM was proposed by # . (Jørgensen, 1992) . References . Jørgensen, B., 1992.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
